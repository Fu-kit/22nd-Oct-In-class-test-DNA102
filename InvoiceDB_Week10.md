-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Script chunk**
```sql
-- 1) If 'InvoiceDB' does not exist, please create it
IF DB_ID('InvoiceDB') IS NULL
    CREATE DATABASE InvoiceDB;
GO

USE InvoiceDB;
GO
English explanation

"GO" is needed to run each function (CREATE and USE).
```

"IF ... IS NULL" and "CREATE..." are used to avoid creating a duplicate database.
Without this condition, the same database could be created twice or more.
